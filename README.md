# üöó Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Learning Journey

Welcome to my self-guided learning journey to master **Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs)**. This repository documents my research, notes, experiments, and hands-on projects in the SDV ecosystem using C++, ROS2, VSS, and modern automotive middleware.

---

## üìå Goals

- Understand SDV architecture and layered software stacks
- Build signal-based and service-based communication modules
- Learn AUTOSAR Adaptive, ROS2, vsomeip, and VSS
- Contribute to open-source SDV projects

---

## üìö Learning Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: SDV Foundations
- [x] SDV architecture overview
- [x] Eclipse SDV, SOAFEE, AGL
- [x] Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Vehicle Signals
- [x] KUKSA.val setup & simulation
- [ ] Add custom signals using VSS schema
- [ ] MQTT signal publishing demo

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Middleware (C++)
- [ ] Learn vsomeip and ara::com
- [ ] Create a C++ service and client
- [ ] Explore Fast DDS with ROS2

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: ROS2 + Autoware
- [ ] Install ROS2 Foxy / Humble
- [ ] ROS2 pub/sub with vehicle signals
- [ ] Autoware sensor node demo

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: OS & Containers
- [ ] AGL sample app in Docker
- [ ] Create Yocto layer for demo ECU
- [ ] Understand SOAFEE orchestration

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Security & OTA
- [ ] Read about Uptane
- [ ] Explore secure firmware update mechanism
